In the Earth’s history, there have already been several climatic changes. With periods of glaciation and warming. These changes were caused by small variations in the earth’s orbit which made change the quantity of arrival of solar energy on the Earth.

Today, everybody knows that currently, climate is changing. And it is most certainly our fault, the fault of the Human.

For us, Human, like a biological animal, an increase of some degrees doesn’t much direct importance. But for sensitive living organisms or ecosystems, like coral reefs, it is a huge threat. These organisms are adapted at a stable environment. If they are sudden variations, they are not able to adapt, are doing badly and may even disappear completely from the surface of the Earth. It is what is happening now for many species. According to the IUCN (The International Union for Conservation of Nature), more than 31.000 species are in danger of extinction. It is why we have to do our utmost to protect these species which are suffering of our acts. 

This portfolio is focused on coral reefs, that are organisms which are clearly impacted by climate change. Corals are fragile animals that are mainly under the threat of the rise of temperature and the acidification of oceans. With these variations of their environment, corals can expel their symbiotics algae. This phenomenon is called “bleaching events” because with this expulsion, they become white. The bleaching is bad for corals because it is algae that give their nutrients. If the perturbations of the environment last too long, corals die.

To conserve these fabulous ecosystems, scientists develop several innovative technics to protect, maintain or recreate these unique ecosystems.
