*Explanation for "coral bleaching events" : with rising temperature, corals expel the important algae that give their colour and their essential nutrients.

| General topic?               | This article deals with drones which are use to make a cartography of the coral reef.                                                                                                                                      |
| Procedure/what was examined? |  These drones are a new engineer invention. They are able to take perfectly clear shots through the water.                                                                                                                 |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | These shots allow to have a 3D map of the coral reef. This will allow to the scientists to track their responses to the climate change.                                                                                    |
| Remaining questions?         | Could the drones help us in other works like for example to feel a population of trees in a parcel of a forest?                                                                                                            |
