My blog will deal with the corals. I have choose this topic because I am concerned about climate change and the threat it poses to nature. Under this threat, species have to adapt to the new conditions of their environment. 
corals suffer particularly from rising ocean temperatures. They are among those who have the most difficulty adapting. That is why, they interest me.
